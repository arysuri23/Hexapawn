# Hexapawn
Hexapawn is a game in which the user competes against the computer in a series of tic-tac-toe/chess like games. After each of these games, the computer adjusts their strategy by "learning" which moves lead to wins/losses, so eventually, the computer will win every game.

Notice the computer does not make the same first move as the previous game, because it knows that move leads to a loss. This is how the computer "learns" and eventually only performs moves that will result in a win.
